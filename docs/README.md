# Description:

Our project is a collision prediction system that can warn drivers of impending collisions. Our design can track a single object outside of the car and detect whether it will collide with the host vehicle 2 seconds before a predicted collision. It can also track multiple objects and their distances in real-time in restricted testing conditions. 


# System Overview

Here is the block diagram of the system: 

  <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x medium-up-2 grid-margin-x-bottom" id="boxShadow">
    <div class="cell">
      <div class="hoverTarget">
        <img class="imageTarget" src="images/systemblockdiagram.jpg" alt="abstract0">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
